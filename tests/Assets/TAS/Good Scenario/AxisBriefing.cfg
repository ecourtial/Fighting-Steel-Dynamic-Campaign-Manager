From BDU

Admiral

We are now at war with Britain and France.
Your training mission turns now to a total war action. The BDU will send you a new message shortly, stating your final objective, which will be:
to escape the Mediterranean Sea
or to flee Eastward and to join the turkish ports to pull Turkey in to the war in the Axis side.

Whether the objective which is going to be selected by the BDU, you are free from your moves, which include:
- Change your path regularly in order to decept the enemy
- Attacking convoys;
- Playing hide and seek

However, you are encouraged to avoid direct confrontation with enemy warships to maintain you fighting capacities for the right opportunities.
